#### PARTITION BY clause with ROW_NUMBER()
We can use the SQL PARTITION BY clause with ROW_NUMBER() function to have a row number of each row. 
We define the following parameters to use ROW_NUMBER with the SQL PARTITION BY clause.

SELECT Customercity, 
       CustomerName, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Customercity ORDER BY OrderAmount DESC) AS "Row Number", 
       OrderAmount, 
       COUNT(OrderID) OVER(PARTITION BY Customercity) AS CountOfOrders, 
       AVG(Orderamount) OVER(PARTITION BY Customercity) AS AvgOrderAmount, 
       MIN(OrderAmount) OVER(PARTITION BY Customercity) AS MinOrderAmount, 
       SUM(Orderamount) OVER(PARTITION BY Customercity) TotalOrderAmount
FROM [dbo].[Orders];
